# Inventory Management CRUD App

This is a sleek and modern full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing an inventory of items. The project features a dynamic, single-page interface built with vanilla JavaScript and a powerful PHP backend that interacts with an SQLite database. The user interface is styled with a professional "glassmorphism" design, providing a clean and intuitive user experience.
